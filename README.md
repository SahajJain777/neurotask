# Neurotask: Intelligent File Organizer

Neurotask is an intelligent, extensible file organization tool designed to help you manage and declutter your directories using advanced strategies. Whether you‚Äôre a developer, researcher, or student, Neurotask leverages classic and modern data structuring techniques to sort, categorize, and make sense of your files‚Äîeither via a user-friendly GUI or a powerful CLI.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Multiple Organization Strategies:**  
  - **Extension-based:** Group files by their type (e.g., `.py`, `.txt`, `.jpg`).
  - **Timeline-based:** Organize files by creation or modification date.
  - **Semantic-based:** Use content analysis to cluster similar files.
  - **Intent-based:** Organize files based on inferred user intent or project context.

- **Dual Interface:**  
  - **GUI:** Intuitive graphical interface for easy use.
  - **CLI:** Command-line power for automation and scripting.

- **Voice Assistant (Optional):**  
  - Enable voice commands in the GUI for hands-free operation.

- **Configurable:**  
  - Easily customize file categories and behaviors via `config.json`.

## üì¶ Example Usage

Suppose you have a directory with the following files:

```
project/
  - report.docx
  - data.csv
  - script.py
  - image.png
  - notes.txt
  - presentation.pptx
```

### 1. Organize by Extension (CLI)

```bash
python run_neurotask.py --cli --dir project --type extension
```

**Result:**

```
project/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Documents/
  ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ report.docx
  ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notes.txt
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data/
  ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data.csv
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Scripts/
  ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ script.py
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Images/
  ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ image.png
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Presentations/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation.pptx
```

### 2. Organize by Timeline (GUI)

- Launch the GUI:
  ```bash
  python run_neurotask.py --gui
  ```
- Select your directory and choose "Timeline" as the organization type.
- Files are grouped into folders like `2024-06`, `2024-05`, etc., based on their modification dates.

```

### Main Flow

1. **Entry Point:**  
   - The user runs `run_neurotask.py`, which calls `main.py`.
   - Command-line arguments determine whether to launch the GUI or CLI.

2. **Argument Parsing:**  
   - The system parses options like `--cli`, `--gui`, `--dir`, and `--type`.

3. **Mode Selection:**  
   - **GUI:** Launches a Tkinter-based interface (`neurotask_ui.py`). Optionally enables a voice assistant.
   - **CLI:** Imports the relevant organizer module based on the `--type` argument.

4. **Organization Logic:**  
   - **Extension-based:** Uses a mapping from `config.json` to group files by type.
   - **Timeline-based:** Sorts files into folders by date.
   - **Semantic-based:** Analyzes file content to cluster similar files (e.g., using embeddings or keyword extraction).
   - **Intent-based:** Attempts to infer the user's intent/project context for grouping.

5. **File Operations:**  
   - Uses the `file_manager` package to read, move, and organize files safely.

6. **Logging:**  
   - All actions and errors are logged for transparency and debugging.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neurotask.git
   cd neurotask
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash

   ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize file categories, extensions, and other behaviors.

## ü§ñ Extending Neurotask

Want to add a new organization strategy?  
- Create a new module in `neurotask/organizer/`.
- Implement your logic and add it to the CLI argument parser in `main.py`.

---

## üìö DSA Concepts Used

- **Hash Maps:** For fast extension-to-category lookups.
- **Sorting & Grouping:** Timeline and semantic organization use sorting/grouping algorithms.
- **Clustering:** Semantic-based organization may use clustering (e.g., k-means) for grouping similar files.
- **Modular Design:** Each strategy is a separate module, following SOLID principles.
